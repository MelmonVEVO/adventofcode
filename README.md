# Dylan's Advent of Code answers
This repository contains the code I wrote to answer the Advent of Code challenges. Written in C!


The code itself is guaranteed to make you sick to your stomach as I prioritised getting an answer instead of good practice.
I promise to pick up C Programming: A Modern Approach and Understanding and Using C Pointers as soon as I'm done with this.

When the year ends, I will clean it up and comment the files to explain how it works!
